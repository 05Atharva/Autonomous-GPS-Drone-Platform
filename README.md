# Autonomous GPS-Based Drone Platform

An autonomous quadcopter platform developed as a club project, capable of
**GPS-based navigation, waypoint missions, and Return-to-Launch (RTL) failsafe**.

This project focuses on **hardware integration, flight-controller configuration,
telemetry design, and autonomous flight logic** rather than custom flight firmware.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and build an **autonomous drone system**
that can safely execute pre-planned missions using GPS navigation and onboard
sensor data.

The drone supports:
- Auto takeoff
- Waypoint-based autonomous missions
- Return-to-Launch (RTL) failsafe

## 🧠 System Highlights

- GPS-based autonomous navigation
- Custom-built HC-12 telemetry system
- Mission planning using Mission Planner (Radiolink)
- Sensor fusion using IMU, GPS, and barometer
- Emphasis on safety and failsafe behavior
