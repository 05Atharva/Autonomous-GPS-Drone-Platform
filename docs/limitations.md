# System Limitations

This project has several known limitations, primarily due to
its educational and prototype nature.

## Current Limitations

- No obstacle avoidance capability
- Relies entirely on GPS-based navigation
- Performance dependent on GPS signal quality
- No vision-based perception
- Limited autonomous decision-making (preplanned missions only)

## Environmental Constraints

- Not suitable for indoor autonomous navigation
- Sensitive to strong wind conditions
- Requires clear GPS reception

These limitations define the scope for future enhancements.
