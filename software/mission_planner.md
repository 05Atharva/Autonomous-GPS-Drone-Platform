# Mission Planner Usage

Mission Planner (Radiolink) was used as the Ground Control Station (GCS) for:

- Waypoint mission creation
- Autonomous mode selection
- Telemetry monitoring
- GPS position visualization

Waypoints were defined with latitude, longitude, and altitude parameters
before flight.
